# Reversi-AI
An AI that plays Reversi, almost guaranteed to beat any human player and can hold its own against other tough AIs.
Improve the heuristic function that takes into account the stone advantage (parity), corner control, and mobility (# of possible moves). 
Minimax and alpha-beta algorithm optimized to run fastly. There is a unique heuristic which takes into account multiple factors contributing 
to the value of a boardstate. Still to do: run processes concurrently, experiment with reinforced learning models.
